/*
 First, you'll need to import the PodcastsKit framework into your Xcode project. You can do this by adding the following line to your project's Swift file:

 */
import PodcastsKit


    
/*
 Next, you can use the PKPodcast class to represent a podcast. You can create a new instance of PKPodcast by passing in the podcast's feed URL as a URL object:
 */
    
    let feedUrl = URL(string: "https://example.com/podcast/feed.xml")!
    let podcast = PKPodcast(feedURL: feedUrl)
    
    
/*
 Once you have a PKPodcast object, you can use the PKPodcastController class to interact with it. For example, you can use PKPodcastController.shared to retrieve a list of episodes for a podcast:
 */
    PKPodcastController.shared.episodes(for: podcast) { (episodes, error) in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error retrieving episodes: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else if let episodes = episodes {
            print("Retrieved \(episodes.count) episodes")
        }
    }

/*
 This code will asynchronously retrieve the list of episodes for the podcast and print the number of episodes retrieved to the console.

 Finally, you can use the MPNowPlayingInfoCenter class to display information about the currently playing episode in the system's Now Playing interface:
 */

    let nowPlayingInfo = [
        MPMediaItemPropertyTitle: "Episode Title",
        MPMediaItemPropertyArtist: "Podcast Title",
        MPMediaItemPropertyPlaybackDuration: TimeInterval(3600),
        MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyElapsedPlaybackTime: TimeInterval(1800)
    ]
    MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo
